    <h3>My Trip Around the USA on a Segway
Segway'n USA<h3>
<h6>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</h6>
    <h3>August 20, 2012</h3>

    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li> Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li> Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>
        July 14, 2012 I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>
            <br>"Passing cars,</br>
            <br> When you can't see,</br>
            <br>May get you,</br>
            <br>A glimpse, Of eternity."</br>
        </blockquote> I definitely won't be passing any cars. June 2, 2012 My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li> protein bar</li>
        </ul> Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
